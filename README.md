# TwitchFeed

TwitchFeed is a simple and lightweight website designed to provide access to multiple TwitchAPI search endpoints.

### Features
  - Responsive layout allows it to be viewed on most modern browsers comfortably.
  - Additional search options are accessible upon clicking "Advanced"
  - Results pages can be navigated by clicking on the respective left or right triangle.
  - Allows users to search using Twitch.tv's API for Streams/Channels/Games.
  - Results can be displayed at 10/25/50/100 per page.
  - Clicking on "Twitch Feed!" will display current most viewed streams.
  - Clicking on any stream search listing will display an embedded Twitch player that persists even while searching.  Can be closed by clicking on the grey "x".
  - Clicking on a channel search listing will open a new tab that redirects to that channel.
  - Clicking on a game search listing will open a new tab that redirects to a Twitch.TV list of all currently active streams of that game.

### Version
1.0

### Tech
Twitch Feed makes use of no front-end frameworks; however, it was written in similarly to an MVC architectural pattern. 

### Pending features
  - Pressing left or right arrow (and left or right swipe on mobile) will cycle through pages.
  - Adding authentication and providing users a way to access, update, and interact with their account. (Can display all user followed streams as default rather than current top streams.)
  - Hit API endpint for listing top games being streamed.
  - Add ability to toggle/open chat window for the currently open Twitch stream.
